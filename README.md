# Women of Bandura

Women of Bandura - North America (WOB) is a digital program archive created in collaboration with the Women's Bandura Ensemble of North America (WBENA) to highlight the contribution of the section of society traditionally excluded from the specific performance culture. Women have and continue to play a vital role in advancing the rich history represented by the instrument that has been synonymous with Ukrainian identity.

This inaugural version of WOB was created over the Spring 2025 Semester as part of the course DHUM 70002 Methods and Practices at the CUNY Graduate Center. 

As the team transitions ownership of the project to WBENA, we want to make sure the processes for contribution are documented for those taking up its maintenance.
