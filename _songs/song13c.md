lyrics-english: |-
  So - for John on St. John’s Day
  We had a little bonfire - yea.
  As it burned - so it smoked
  Anna dirtied up her coat.
  Couldn’t wash it clean at all
  Vasyl had to help withal.
  Couldn’t wring it out so well;
  Vasyl had to help - so swell.
  On St. John’s just for a laugh;
  We’ll roast the boys a tasty calf.
