lyrics-english: "Lullaby once - twice lullaby until we pass the Danube by\r\nUntil
  we pass the Danube’s swell and beat upon the drum as well -\r\nThat’s when - Mama
  - you can cry - when you see him on the fly.\r\nHe is serving in the war - On a
  horse as black as tar.\r\nOn a tar-black horse he rides with sword and rifle at
  his side."
