  Lord - oh the Great and Almighty;
  Protect our beloved Ukraine;
  Bless her with freedom and light
  Of your holy rays.
  With learning and knowledge enlighten
  Us - your children small
  In love pure and everlasting
  Let us - oh Lord - grow.
  We pray - oh Lord Almighty
  Protect our beloved Ukraine;
  Grant our people and country
  All your kindness and grace.
  Bless us with freedom - bless us with wisdom;
  Guide into kind world;
  Bless us - oh Lord - with good fortune
  Forever and ever more.
