lyrics-english: |-
  A little girl went walking on the street
  wearing very red shoes on her feet.
  Chorus:
  Stand - you oak so green.
  on oak acorns seen.
  Dew fell on the cleared-out field
  washed the street on St. John’s feast.
  Wearing very red shoes on her feet
  bought by a Kozak boy on Market Street.
  Mother would not ever let me go.
  locked me in the larder - just so.
  Sit there - darling daughter - in the shop
  until the evening parties all break up.
  I dug my way right out of there - dear Mum,
  went on the street and simply had my fun.
